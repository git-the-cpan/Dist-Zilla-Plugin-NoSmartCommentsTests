NAME

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::NoSmartCommentsTests - Make sure no
    Smart::Comments escape into the wild

VERSION

    This document describes version 0.008 of
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::NoSmartCommentsTests - released August 07, 2015 as
    part of Dist-Zilla-Plugin-NoSmartCommentsTests.

SYNOPSIS

        ; In C<dist.ini>:
        [Test::NoSmartComments]

DESCRIPTION

    This is an extension of Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InlineFiles, providing the
    following file:

      xt/release/no-smart-comments.t - test to ensure no Smart::Comments

NOTE

    The name of this plugin has turned out to be somewhat misleading, I'm
    afraid: we don't actually test for the _existance_ of smart comments,
    rather we ensure that Smart::Comment is not used by any file checked.
