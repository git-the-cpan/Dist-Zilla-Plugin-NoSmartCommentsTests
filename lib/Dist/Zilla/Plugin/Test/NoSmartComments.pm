=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::NoSmartComments - Make sure no Smart::Comments escape into the wild

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.008 of Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::NoSmartComments - released August 07, 2015 as part of Dist-Zilla-Plugin-NoSmartCommentsTests.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    ; In C<dist.ini>:
    [Test::NoSmartComments]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an extension of L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InlineFiles>, providing the
following file:

  xt/release/no-smart-comments.t - test to ensure no Smart::Comments

=head1 NOTE

The name of this plugin has turned out to be somewhat misleading, I'm afraid:
we don't actually test for the _existance_ of smart comments, rather we
ensure that Smart::Comment is not used by any file checked.

=head1 SEE ALSO

Please note B<I do not expect to be gittip'ed or flattr'ed for this work>,
rather B<it is simply a very pleasant surprise>. I largely create and release
works like this because I need them or I find it enjoyable; however, don't let
that stop you if you feel like it ;)
